## Welcome

Reliability of your offerings is non-negotiable to users, and too often is siloed to the various elements of your app and infrastructure. Achieving a customer-centric view of reliability - going beyond incident management and identifying day-to-day issues affecting the user experience - requires a holistic approach. Implementing Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and error budgeting allows you to monitor your application as a singular entity, prioritizing issues that affect the user and identifying the invisible mini-incidents that cause product abandonment and switching.

### Learning Objectives
In this workshop, we will walk you through how to set up AWS Observability for your application, and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) on your AWS infrastructure to provide a hands-on experience using AWS services and Nobl9â€™s SLO-based reliability platform to build reliability and observability into your AWS-hosted product.
