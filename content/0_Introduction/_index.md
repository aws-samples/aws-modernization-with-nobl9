In this workshop, you will learn to use Nobl9 to set Service Level Objectives (SLOs) on an example application running in AWS. You will learn how to set SLOs on data from AWS CloudWatch and Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. The workshop will include settings SLOs using Nobl9's web user interface, and via Terraform. 

### Workshop Structure 
This workshop uses the AWS One Observability workshop's example application as a base. It will guide you through the setup process, starting with the prerequisites, through setting up the example application, and then setting up SLOs.
