## Why Service Level Objectives? <!-- MODIFY THIS HEADING TO REFLECT THE PROBLEM THE WORKSHOP IS ADDRESSING -->

Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are a crucial part of managing and improving the performance and reliability of services, especially in complex and dynamic environments like cloud services or large-scale applications. Here are several use cases for SLOs:

### Aligning Business and Technical Goals <!-- MODIFY THIS SUBHEADING -->
**Clear Expectations**: SLOs help define and communicate clear expectations between service providers and customers, ensuring both parties have a mutual understanding of acceptable performance levels.

**Business Alignment**: By tying technical metrics to business objectives, SLOs ensure that engineering efforts are aligned with what matters most to the business and its users.

### Improving Customer Satisfaction <!-- MODIFY THIS HEADING -->
**Customer Trust**: Consistently meeting SLOs builds customer trust and satisfaction, as customers rely on the service to meet their needs reliably.

**Proactive Management**: SLOs allow for proactive management of services. By monitoring performance against SLOs, teams can identify and address issues before they impact customers.

### Prioritizing Work
**Resource Allocation**: SLOs help prioritize engineering efforts by focusing on what is most critical for maintaining service reliability. This ensures resources are allocated efficiently.

**Incident Management**: During incidents, SLOs provide a clear framework for decision-making, helping teams focus on restoring service to meet agreed-upon objectives.

### Driving Continuous Improvement
**Performance Benchmarking**: SLOs provide a benchmark for performance, enabling continuous monitoring and improvement over time.

**Incident Retrospectives**: When SLOs are missed, they provide a basis for post-incident reviews, driving improvements and preventing future occurrences.

### Risk Management
**Error Budgets**: SLOs are paired with error budgets, which quantify the acceptable level of failure. This helps balance the trade-off between new feature development and maintaining reliability.

**Risk Awareness**: Understanding and managing SLOs increases awareness of potential risks and helps in planning mitigations proactively.

### Transparency and Accountability
**Accountability**: SLOs establish accountability for service performance, ensuring teams understand their responsibilities and are held accountable for meeting targets.

**Transparency**: Regularly reporting on SLO performance fosters transparency within the organization and with customers, enhancing trust and collaboration.

### Regulatory and Compliance Needs
**Compliance**: For industries with regulatory requirements, SLOs help ensure that services comply with necessary standards and regulations.

**Audit Trail**: SLOs provide a documented history of service performance, useful for audits and compliance checks.
