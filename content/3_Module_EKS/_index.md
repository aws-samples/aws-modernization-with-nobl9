### Setting SLOs on an Elastic Kubernetes Service

Managed Kubernetes control plane offerings have continued to grow in popularity, and Amazon's EKS is no exception. This
module takes us through a set of starter SLOs that measure the health and performance of an EKS cluster. In addition,
because Kubernetes clusters have some visibility into what is running inside the cluster, it's possible to measure the
health of the workload a cluster is supporting, at least from the point of view of the cluster and infrastructure.
